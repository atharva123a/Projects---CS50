        <p>
            IQ stands for <strong>Intelligence Quotient</strong> and is used to denote the
            score derieved from a set of standardized tests carried out to judge human intelligence
            based on a set of tests. This score gained immense popularity as a tool for juding the
            mental performance of a person based on his mental age. Prior to the concept of IQ there were
            different ways in which people measured intellegience in the<a id = "ev" href="evaluation.html"> historic times</a>.

        <!--Here we explain who introduced the concept of IQ-->
        <p>The term IQ was coined by psychologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Stern_(psychologist)">William Stern</a>
        for the German term Intelligenzquotient, his term for a scoring method for intelligence tests at
        University of Breslau he advocated in a 1912 book.</p>
        <p>In the historic times, behavior was a major factor while judging the intelligence
        of children. These behavioral attributes for judging the intelligence of children
        are still considered, however the importance that these had have changed over time.
        Children these days are judged in terms of emotional intelligence more than behavioral
        intelligence and thus to even out the judgement for intelligence we now give
        more emphasis to these IQ tests. There were a lot of <a href="psychologists.html">psychologists</a>
        that helped in developing the IQ test standards that we have today.</p><br><br>


        <h3 id="numbers">IQ Scores and Evaluation</h3><br>
        <p>
            If you have read the <a>times when tests were evaluated</a> based
            on behavorial intelligence and were not standardized, the major concern
            was people who gave the tests could have different emotional responses
            to different situations and this becomes more subjective than objective.
            This also means that the tests cannot judge the intelligence of all
            people irrespective of where they come from. Thus, modern tests were
            developed which have tried to give equal opportunities to people from a
            all walks of life. The tests now pose questions which challenge the cognitive
            and reasoning abilities of the person which are more objective and can be compared
            making it easier for evaluation. The evaluation is done by using a bell
            curve (as in normal distribution curve) which in fact was used in the
            early times by psychologists such as
            <a href="psychologists.html#francis">Francis Galton</a> to plot and figure out
            the variation in intelligence across generations.

         <h3 id="learn">Is Your IQ really <strong>THAT</strong> Important?</h3>
         <p>Let's take a look...</p>
         <p>
             When we take a closer look at <a>IQ tests</a> we would figure out soon
             that these are more or less imperfect. They try to judge the intellectual
             ability of humans by creating certain puzzles that challenging their cognitive
             ability and forcing them to use certain parts of their brains. The way the scores
             are given are based on how fast and accurate the answers to all the questions
             attempted are given. This, however, does not gaurantee that the person displays the
             same qualitites while making decisions, or when put in curcumstances which are not
             <a href="">ideal</a><br>
             The reason these tests are not perfect, is because they do not test the
             creativity, emotional intelligence, social skills and even wisdom. These points are
             actually massively underrated, but are very important infact, even more than your IQ.
             There are times when people with better emotional intelligence will be better at decision
             making than another person who is weak emotionally, but has a higher IQ score. The learning
             of facts faster, is great, but what is more interesting is what you can do with the knowledge
             that you have accumulated. There are a lot of evidences that higher IQ is not equal to
             success and that is also fairly visible considering that the people who do good in schools
             <a href="life.html">do not always</a> do great in their lives.
