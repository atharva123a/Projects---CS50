        <h1>IQ BEFORE IQ</h1><br>
        <p>The concept of IQ was introduced in 1912, so how was intelligence evaluated before?</p><br>

        <h3>Behavorial Intelligence and it's Significance.

        <p>
            Historically, even before IQ tests were devised, there were attempts to
            classify people into intelligence categories by observing their behavior in
            daily life.Those other forms of behavioral observation are still important for
            validating classifications based primarily on IQ test scores. Both intelligence
            classification by observation of behavior outside the testing room and
            classification by IQ testing depend on the definition of "intelligence"
            used in a particular case and on the reliability and error of estimation
            in the classification procedure.

        <h3>Contribution of psychologists</h3><br>
        <p>The early developments in the field of measuring intelligence were taken
        by people who were interested in the human brain and the way external simulations
        such as any form of brain activity and the results were based on reflexes, precision
        and speed at which these tasks were executed. In fact even today these fundamentals
        are crucial for any IQ test to be standardized. The early scientists experiments thought
        of intelligence to be dependent on head size, reflexes and genetics. However, when they
        were actually asked to set up equipments and prove the accuracy of these criterias, they
        weren't were successful and thus there was no standard IQ test as such, making it
        difficult to standardize this notion of intelligence.
        Among many contributors the major contributors were: <a href="psychologists.html#francis">Francis Galton</a>,
        <a href="psychologits.html#alfred">Alfred Binet</a>,
        <a href="psychologists.html#robert" class='redirect'>Robert Yerks</a>
        and <a href="psycholgists.html#david">David Wechsler</a> (a lot of other psychologists have not being mentioned).
        The works of all these psychologists have helped create standard tests that
        could be applied to majority of the students.
