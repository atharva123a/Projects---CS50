        <h1>Psychologists and their obsession with the Human <strong>Brain</strong></h1>
        <p>There was lots of contributors to the modern day IQ tests, let's take a look at them.</p>

        <h3>Pyschologists and the Cult of Intelligence:</h3><br>

            There was major research done during the first world war for standardizing
            tests for recruiting soldiers, because it ensured that the soldiers were quick
            to follow orders and it times could make rational decisions faster. A major contribution
            to this standardization of tests was done by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Yerkes"> Robert Yerkes</a>.
            In 1975 with he carried out tests for over 1.75 million americans and grouped them
            based on their rational thinking skills. The criteria for getting selected inside the army
            was that appliants who had at least the grade "C" were recruited inside the army.
            However these tests ultimately failed since there were lots of
            <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-iq-test-wars-why-screening-for-intelligence-is-still-so-controversial-81428">incidents </a>
            of racial and national discrimination and this ultimately failed to bring
            any standard to tests that were taken.

            <h4>Francis Galton and Behavioral Genetics</h4><br>
            Francis Galton was a lot of things that you can check on his

            However his major contributions were in the fields of behavioral genetics.
            He was a differential psychologist and led early experimental studies in the
            field of genetic variation in behavioral traits carrying out experiments with
            the tools that he built and are now the foundation for behavoiral
            genetics. The works of this genius have helped modern psychology in a
            lot of ways, such as use of the bell-curve for calculating the differences
            in heridetary traits and such. There are some really significant contributions
            that can be explored in <a href="http://galton.org/psychologist/">depth</a>
            in his theories.

            <h4>Alfred Binet: The First standard IQ test</h4><br>
            <img src="alfred.png" alt="Alfred Binet" title="Alfred Binet"
            ALIGN="right" width="25%">
            Alfred Binet was a French psyhchologist who along with Th√©odore Simon
            was created the first ever standard IQ test, called the <strong>Binet-Simon</strong> test.
            They were asked by the French Ministry to check whether the students were
            learning from French schools and check for their performance. These tests
            classified students based on their mental age, with tasks increasing in difficulty
            as the tests progressed. However, even Binet clarified that the intelligence of
            as a phenomenon which is varied across multiple factors which can't be all put together
            into one test.

            <h4>David Wechsler: The First IQ Test</h4>
            <img src="david.png" alt="David Wechsler" title="David Wechsler"
            ALIGN="right" width= "30%">
            David Wechsler was again a psychologist who advocated the first ever
            standard IQ test, called the <strong> Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)</strong>
             in 1939. David challenged the Binet-Simon test, stating the objective of the test was
             single core instead of multi-core. When the Binet-IQ test was released, he again cited it to
             be non-satisfactory, because his philosophy of intelligence was different that that of Binet.
             The tests produced results which were meant to be dealing with intelligence and
             cognitive ability of adolescents. These tests were initially designed by Wechsler
             for his patients, but eventually were accpeted as a global standard for IQ tests.
