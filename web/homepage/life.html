        <div>By reading the quote, you might be thinking that Atharva Salokhe is a fucking genius. Well, let me tell you that he has an IQ score of about 102 (based on the <a href="https://www.mensa.org/">Mensa IQ test</a>
        that he took online while battling distractions from his mom and his brother). That score
        means that he is massively average according to Mensa, and his score is slightly to the
        right of the curve, making him slightly smarted than people to his left, or so you might think.
        But, what intelligence means could be very subjective. Does solving certain puzzles
        extremly fast mean that you are smart? Do your cognitive skills matter a lot in your
        intelligence? Then, what about people who are visually impaired? Are they not smart?
        Let's try to answer some these questions.
        </div><br><br>

        <h4>Intelligence is <strong>Abstract</strong></h4><br>
        <div>
            When you look at children, the way we analyze their intelligence is based on how
            creative they are, or how perspicacious they can be while doing certain tasks. But, what
            really makes us curious is how quick-witted they can be at times. These certainly are
            a few factors through which we might try to judge the intelligence of kids. But, at a certain
            point they are all asked to give the IQ tests to "standardize" their intelligence.
            This is actually the first step to kill someone's creativity. The reason these tests are
            so popular is that they give you a number, a number which you can use to rank your
            kid among the vast population in this world. You are subconsciously trying to make sure
            that your kid is competent, in a race which is itself incompetent to test your kid's competence.
            The reason kids who do great in school do not always do great in life is that they
            basically are really competitive at this incompetent race.
        </div><br>

        <div>
            The reason this system is flawed is because all they can possibly test is the memory,
            cognitive ability and the speed at which you could do all those seemingly important problems.
            What we so often completely neglect is the fact that, there could be better ways of solving those
            same problems. What school forces us to do really, is to solve the problem in the same way as was taught
            and to do it as fast as possible. All the competitive exams would be so much fun if we'd
            given students the chance to explore possibilites about solving a problem instead of pressurizing them to
            them to the core about solving a bunch of problems really fast, without making any errors and
            doing well than the rest of the competitors. What really sucks is the fact that students
            find themselves lacking, if they couldn't <strong>crack</strong> a certain entrance test, when infact, it is supposed to be just a
            test that gets you admitted to a certain institute, but instead ends up making you believe you are stupid.
            Well, you can't blame the system completely. The parents are also equally responsible.
            I strongly believe that if the parents start to love their children unconditionally, not
            when they do well in some test, or crack some entrance exam, the suicide rates could go
            drastically down. It may not seem like it, but Indian parents specifically pressurize their
            children in subtle ways. This does impact mental health and is a major reason
            why student commit such terrible acts.
        </div><br><br>
        <h4>So, how do you check someone's ability?</h4><br>
        <p>
            The ability and intelligence of a person will definitely be reflected in his work, right?
            Let's break this down. The concept that success equals intelligence is cool, it is
            closely related to how intelligently a person makes certain decisions in his life. But
            what is more important is the fact that he his happy, with whatever he has or is been doing
            with his life. Imagine having lots of money, but still be unhappy. Well, when you don't
            have a lot of money, you might be tricked by the advertisers that more things equals
            more happiness, but is that true? Aren't there lots of people in this world, who have lots
            of good things, but are still unhappy and satisfied? Money, will obviously solve some
            problems, but it is not capable of filling a certain void inside you.
            The definition of intelligence has to change. What I believe true intelligence should be
            is that it is the ability of a person to observe things that happen in his life and
            learn from everything that he could. There are a million things in this world, of which
            you don't know. Out of these million things, if you could pick at-least one thing and
            use your creativity to explore and improve on that one thing, you are successful.
            WTF, this became so corny, anyways, thank you for reading.
